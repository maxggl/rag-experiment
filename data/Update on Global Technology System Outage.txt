March 16 Update:

I wanted to provide an update to my last message. I’m pleased to share that all of our restaurants globally are now open and serving customers. Local technology teams will continue to provide support as needed. In the coming days, we will be analyzing the issue and pushing for accountability across our teams and third-party vendors.

We sincerely regret the inconvenience that we know this caused you, your teams and your customers. Thank you again for your patience and your support as our teams worked together to tirelessly resolve this issue.


March 15 Status:

At approximately midnight CDT on Friday, McDonald’s experienced a global technology system outage, which was quickly identified and corrected. Many markets are back online, and the rest are in the process of coming back online. We are closely working with those markets that are still experiencing issues. Notably, this issue was not directly caused by a cybersecurity event; rather, it was caused by a third-party provider during a configuration change.

Reliability and stability of our technology are a priority, and I know how frustrating it can be when there are outages. I understand that this impacts you, your restaurant teams and our customers. What happened today has been an exception to the norm, and we are working with absolute urgency to resolve it. Thank you for your patience, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.
